We are confident that you will enjoy our newest version of FotoFlix.  Some of our early users knew us only as FotoFlix.com. After taking what our users loved about FotoFlix and adding tons of new features, a year later we decided we had to give our new product a new name. In August of 2006 we launched Photagious. The name Photagious embodies the spirit of our product offering and we know you\'ll love what it offers.  Photagious is where you\'ll feed your own photo addiction and share that addiction with others.  You\'ll <a href="/?action=home.samples">create amazing slideshows</a> with ease!

Allow friends and families to download originals, you can even set your personal page to automatically email them when you\'ve created a <a href="/?action=home.samples">slideshow</a> or added new photos.  We designed this site with you in mind... you\'ll never see an ad next to your photos or <a href="/?action=home.samples">slideshows</a> you create.  Who wants a flashing banner ad next to some of their most prized memories? We don\'t and we thought you wouldn\'t either. </p>
