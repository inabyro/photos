    <td>After years of creating products that allow you to showcase your photos online, we know what you want. The FotoFlix team has spent that last 12 months creating the next version of FotoFlix, which offers more unique features than any other photo sharing product in the marketplace. Yes that's right, more features for you to be creative with your photos and less time and work to create and share your slideshows, and even more important than that... you get all of this for no additional cost.</td>

    <td>Photagious, the new version of FotoFlix was designed with you in mind. Our inspiration was to take what you loved about FotoFlix and build on it...and when we say build we mean build! We have added features that allow you to <a href="http://www.photagious.com/slideshow?5dec0a5231cc330f970cd81159288365">truly make your photos memorable</a> while making it easier for you to share your photos with the world.</td>

    <td>The new Photagious version gives you the ability to tell your story and the freedom to be creative. You can now manipulate a photo by making annotations, adding graphics, drawing on it, adding quote bubbles, creating collages, making animations, adding zoom spots and even adding video to your <a href="http://www.photagious.com/?action=home.samples">slideshows</a>. These enhancements are easily made with our new user-friendly editing system that was developed to make editing effortless. Instead of wrestling with learning the application or having to use multiple applications to accomplish the same task, we've streamlined management and production to work seamlessly together.</td>
