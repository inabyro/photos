We're glad you signed up for a Photagious account but it doesn't look like you've had a chance to upload any photos yet.  You'll never fall in love with Photagious until you get some of your photos on the site.  There are several ways that you can upload your photos including a <a href="http://{SERVER_NAME}/?action=fotobox.upload_installer">desktop uploader</a> (PC users), a <a href="http://{SERVER_NAME}/?action=fotobox.upload_form_compat">bulk Java uploader</a> and a <a href="http://{SERVER_NAME}/?action=fotobox.upload_form_html">basic uploader</a>.
<br/><br/>
There are some brave souls who like to purchase an account even before they use it.  If that's you then you can do so by following this link:
