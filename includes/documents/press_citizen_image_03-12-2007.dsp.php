  <br/><br/>
  <span class="italic">FotoFlix’s next generation image portal, Photagious, provides photographers with new channel for revenue and project work</span>
  <br/><br/>
  <span class="bold">COVINGTON, KY. — Feb. 12, 2007 —</span> FotoFlix today announced that it has incorporated Citizen Image’s content syndication engine into its next generation image portal, Photagious (<a href="/">www.photagious.com</a>).  Through the Photagious website, users are now able to  opt-in their photographs and video for sale via Citizen Image’s online image agency that professionally represents photographic and video content of  photojournalists to editorial outlets around the world.
  <br/><br/>
  Photagious is an online photo and video management system that allows professionals and amateurs alike to store, archive, share, and market their digital photographs and videos. A more robust and versatile image portal than its predecessor FotoFlix 2.0, Photagious is an easy-to-use web-based software application that allows photographs and videos to be formatted for use in Web sites, blogs, business presentations and personal slide shows. Users of Photagious can store thousands of labeled or "tagged" photographs in their password secure online portfolios that they can share with friends, family, photo editors or other interested parties. Photagious' photos are always backed up so users never need fear of ever losing their digital images again because of some power outage or hard drive crash on their PC. 
  <br/><br/>
  "Our goal with Photagious is to offer cutting edge features for the most demanding of photographers," says Jaisen Mathai, CTO of FotoFlix. "Our partnership with Citizen Image now allows us to offer a simple marketing and sales channel for both professional photographers with a regular stream of marketable images as well as amateur shutterbugs with just one or two  newsworthy images; all without leaving our Website."  
  <br/><br/>
  "The inclusion of Photagious users compounds the power of our unique user generated image database and expands the reach of our assignment board to 8,000 additional photographers across more than 15 countries," adds Feargall Kenny, CEO of Citizen Image.
