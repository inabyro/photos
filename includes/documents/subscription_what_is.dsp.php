    <div class="bold">What is it?</div>
    When you add photos or slideshows to your personal page we will automatically send an email to your friends and family letting them know.  
    They will receive an email the next morning with thumbnails of everything that's new on your personal page.  
    It's a great way to keep your friends and family up to date.
    <br/><br/>
    Some of the benefits are:
    <ul>
      <li>We notify your friend and family when your personal page updates</li>
      <li>No need to attach photos in email</li>
      <li>Let others order prints directly from your personal page</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="bold">How does it work?</div>
    Each day our website checks to see if you have added any photos or slideshows to your personal page.  
    If we find either photos or slideshows we send an email to everyone on your list.  
    The email has thumbnails for everything you added that day which link directly to your personal page.  
    Any recipient can easily opt out of receiving emails in the future by clicking a link to unsubscribe.
