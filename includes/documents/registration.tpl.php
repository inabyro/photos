Thank you for registering at Photagious. You can immediately begin uploading your photos and creating slideshows to share with your friends.  When you're ready to share, simply send your friends to your personal home page:
<br/>
<a href="{BASE_URL}/users/{USERNAME}/">{BASE_URL}/users/{USERNAME}</a>
<br/><br/>
Unlike other photo sharing sites, there won't be any annoying ads and we won't require them to enter an email address to view your photos.
<br/><br/>
If you become completely addicted to photagious like many have, you can purchase your account at any time by clicking "" at the top of every page. If not, no worries. Your account will automatically cancel after your trial is over.
<br/><br/>
