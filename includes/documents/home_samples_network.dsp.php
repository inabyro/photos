      How it works</strong>...<br>
      Simply add the people you want to keep updated with their email address. (See the steps illustrated below) Any time you add a slideshow or photos to your personal page it will automatically email them at the end of the day. </p>
      <p><strong>Why not just send an email myself? </strong><br>
  Sending an email with a large attachment such as a photo can take a lot of time, especially if you have a lot of photos to send.&nbsp; We'll send a daily email that has thumbnails of your new photos and slideshows right in the message.&nbsp; Your friends can take a quick look and decide if they want to look at larger versions on your personal page or wait until later.&nbsp; This way their inboxes won't be filled with large attachments and tons of email. </p>
      <p> <strong>What if they don't want to receive emails? </strong><br>
We hate spam as much as everyone else.&nbsp; There will be a link in the email that will let your friends stop receiving future emails about updates to your personal page </p>
        <p><strong>What do you plan on doing with their email addresses? </strong><br>
  Their email address will only be used to notify them of your updates.&nbsp; We will not sell or give away anyone's email address.&nbsp; We value your privacy and the privacy of anyone you bring to the website. <br>
  <br> 
  <strong>Will everyone see every one of my photos or slideshows? </strong><br>
  No.&nbsp; Your friends will only receive an email if you put photos your personal page and if they are included in your subscription list.&nbsp; If you have photos in your account which are marked private then only you will have access to them.</p>
        <p><strong>How often do they get emails?</strong><br>
          They will only get an email when you add new photos to your personal page. <br>
