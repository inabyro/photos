      </strong>The idea for FotoFlix, Inc started in 2002 when we began to look for a good way to share and manage our photos online.&nbsp; After weeks of searching without finding a good solution to our problem, we decided to turn our disappointment into innovation.&nbsp; Our vision was to create a photo management and photo presentation service that would be easy to use and allow people to tell their story with their photos. Almost 4 years later we are proudly doing what we envisioned and much more! Today we have one the most&nbsp;powerful&nbsp;and user friendly product offerings on the web. </td>

      </strong>Some of our early users knew us only as FotoFlix.com. In August of 2006 we launched our most recent version called photagious. The name photagious embodies the spirit of our product offering. Photagious customers can quickly manage and share their photos, make a slideshow in 2 clicks, have fun with photos like never before and have unlimited storage to do so. When you combine all these services with an innovative tool set that is always at your finger tips, you'll find out quickly why we say your photo addiction starts here. </td>
